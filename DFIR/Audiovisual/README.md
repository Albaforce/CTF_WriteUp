Too much noise, i can't hear anything, but can i see ?

# initial analysis :
When i listened to the song there is nothing to figure out, but when rereading the descreption " *i can't hear anything, but **can i see ?*** It came to my mind that there must be some form of steganography. .

# Tool used " sonic visualiser " :
Sonic Visualiser is a free, open-source application multiplatforme, designed to be the first program you reach for when want to study a music recording closely, using it can be helpful cause it allows us to visualize audio frequencies, which can reveal hidden images in the spectrogram.
